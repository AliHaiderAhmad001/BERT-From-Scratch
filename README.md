# BERT-from-Scratch-with-PyTorch 

BERT, which stands for "Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers," is a groundbreaking natural language processing (NLP) model that has had a profound impact on a wide range of NLP tasks. It was introduced by researchers at Google AI in their paper titled "[BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04805.pdf)" in 2018.

## Project Overview

Welcome to "BERTvolution-Building-BERT-from-Scratch"! This project is an ambitious endeavor to create a BERT model from scratch using PyTorch. My goal is to provide an in-depth and comprehensive resource that helps enthusiasts, researchers, and learners gain a precise understanding of BERT, from its fundamental concepts to the implementation details.

**Project Objectives**

1. **Educational Resource**: My primary objective is to create a detailed educational resource that demystifies BERT and the Transformer architecture. I aim to provide step-by-step explanations and code demonstrations for each component of the model, making it accessible to anyone interested in natural language processing and deep learning.

2. **Hands-On Learning**: I encourage hands-on learning. By building the BERT model from the ground up, users can grasp the core principles behind BERT's pretraining and fine-tuning phases. I believe that understanding the model's inner workings is the key to harnessing its power effectively.

3. **Open Source and Accessible**: I'm committed to making this project open source and freely accessible to the community. Learning should be accessible to all, and I aim to contribute to the open-source AI and NLP communities.

4. **On a personal level**: Although I am very familiar with this model and how it works, I had not built it from scratch nor trained models using the concept of masked language modeling (MLM) before. So I'll get my hands dirty a little, it will increase my understanding of it and maybe give me new ideas.

**Key Features**

- **Step-by-Step Implementation**: We break down the BERT model into its constituent parts, guiding you through the implementation of each component.

- **Detailed Explanations**: We provide comprehensive explanations of the underlying concepts, ensuring you grasp not just the "how" but also the "why."

- **Demo and Examples**: Code demonstrations are accompanied by practical examples, making it easier to apply your newfound knowledge to real-world problems.

- **Extensible**: The codebase is designed to be extensible. You can use it as a foundation to experiment with variations of BERT or adapt it for specific NLP tasks.

So, let the games begin...

**Getting Started**

To get started with building BERT from scratch, you must have a comprehensive understanding of transformers (this is very essential in my view). The good news is that I previously built this model from scratch with full explanations you can find [here](https://github.com/AliHaiderAhmad001/Neural-Machine-Translator/blob/main/README.md).

## Documentation
You can read the full explanation of all components in [Demo](https://github.com/AliHaiderAhmad001/BERT-from-Scratch-with-PyTorch/tree/main/demo).
